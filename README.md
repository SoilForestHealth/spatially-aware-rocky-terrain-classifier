<h1>Spatially-Aware Rocky Terrain Prediction</h1>
</div>

## Aim

To instill spatial and depth awareness into the point-based classifier for predicting rocky terrain using topographic and remote sensing data. The relevant information includes:

1. Topography Features (aspect, elevation, flow length, plan curvature, profile curvature, slope, tan curvature, twi)

2. Remote Sensing Features (vegetation index, moisture index, bulk density, soil organic carbon, clay, sand)

## Environment Setup

- Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoilForestHealth/spatially-aware-rocky-terrain-classifier.git
```

- Install all packages in the ```requirements.txt``` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
